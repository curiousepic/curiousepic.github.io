I'm deeply compelled by Effective Altruism; the idea that, with careful examination, some philosophy, and a lot of science, we can optimize the amount of good we do for the world to improve it by orders of magnitude. For example, [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.com) identifies charities a thousand times more cost-effective at saving lives, yet are less funded than others.\r\n\r\nI hope to either work directly on projects that steer the course of history to this path, or donate a significant amount of my income to organizations that do.\r\n\r\nPreviously a project manager for the localization team at Disney Social Games, I realized programming is an incredibly powerful means to this end, and finally took the plunge by joining The Iron Yard Academy to learn web development.\r\n\r\n### Projects for The Iron Yard Academy\r\n\r\n## [Clipboard for SEEDS](https://github.com/SEEDlings/clipboard)\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/114915243\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/114915243\">Demo Day - Clipboard for SEEDS</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/theironyard\">TheIronYard</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
