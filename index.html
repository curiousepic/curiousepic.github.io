        <p>But thinks it needs to be better. I'm driven by the concept of Effective Altruism; the idea that, with careful examination, some philosophy, and a lot of science, we can optimize the amount of good we do for the world to improve it by orders of magnitude. For example, <a href="http://www.givewell.com">GiveWell</a> identifies charities a thousand times more cost-effective at saving lives, yet are less funded than others.</p>

        <p>I hope to either work directly on projects that steer the course of history to this path, or donate a significant amount of my income to organizations that do.</p>

        <p>Previously a Project Manager for the Localization team at Disney Social Games, I realized programming is an incredibly powerful means to this end, and finally took the plunge by joining The Iron Yard Academy to learn web development.</p>

      <h2 class="project">Clipboard for SEEDS</h2>

      <p>Clipboard is a simple, intuitive volunteer check-in app created specifically for <a href="http://www.seedsnc.org">SEEDS</a>, an NC environmental non-profit. The web app saves time and money by both making the check-in process as straightforward as possible, and aiding in capturing volunteer time data, vital to qualify for grants needed to sustain and grow their programs.</p>

      <p>Clipboard integrates with a Salesforce database via API, accommodates the existing idiosynchrocies in data structure, automatically handles complexities previously needing a human in the loop, and serves only what is necessary for a smooth, swift user experience.</p>

      <p>Clipboard was developed over the course of three weeks, by Rebecca Conley, Pete Byrne, and I at The Iron Yard Academy.  Developing Clipboard was a great chance to work with a client, get our hands dirty with real-world data, and optimize a solution for specific and evolving requirements.</p>

    <p>An app that presents a Twitter user with their Tweetingest friends. This project involved learning the Twitter API and OmniAuth integration. I had a lot of fun with this, thinking of ways to visually present the list to the user. I realized we could fairly easily scale a visual element proportionally to the data.</p>

<p>Our week 6 project was to expand a skeletal project used for making homework help requests. It was fully test-driven and involved setting up a mailer for registration verification and notifications, file uploads, as well as our first deployment on Heroku.</p>
<p>My first project working with a partner, and it was a blast; so much fun getting things done twice as fast (or more). We did a lot of planning out the structure on paper and moving post-its around as it evolved.</p>

<p>Our 2nd weekend project was a choice between creating Go Fish or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, in Ruby. I've always been enthralled by Life, but was daunted by the math and logic necessary. I'm glad I chose the one I found more challenging.</p>
