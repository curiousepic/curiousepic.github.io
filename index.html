    <p>But it needs to be better. I'm driven by the concept of Effective Altruism; the idea that, with careful examination, some philosophy, and a lot of science, we can optimize the amount of good we do for the world to improve it by orders of magnitude. For example, <a href="http://www.givewell.com">GiveWell</a> identifies charities that are a thousand times more cost-effective at saving lives, yet are less funded than others.</p>
    <p>In December 2014, I graduated <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/">The Iron Yard Academy</a>, a 12-week immersive course focused on web development with Ruby on Rails. I now hope to utilize my skills and experience to either work directly on projects that steer the course of history towards Effective Altruism, or donate a significant amount of my income to EA organizations.</p>
    <p>Before my decision to take the plunge into programming and web development is a winding path of diverse experience. In the preceding three years, I was a Project Manager for the Localization team at <a href="http://games.disney.com/mobile-apps">Disney Social Games</a>, promoted from QA Analyst. I worked on dozens of social, mobile, and casual games at my time there, and at Playdom, Merscom, and Funcom (yes, I ended up at three successive, unrelated game companies with one-word two-syllable names ending in "-om").  And I kicked it all off with a BA in Art & Design from the College of Design at NCSU.</p>
    <p>I love planning a project, and seeing it in development and fitting its gears together into the envisioned product over the course of its life cycle. But I think I'm most compelled by tweaking and optimizing, as well as integrating with and working within the constraints of, projects or frameworks that already exist.  Whether it's the tiniest details of a website or app layout, detailing my own versions of a game's ruleset or assets, finding efficient shortcuts in a process, or polishing a piece of art or text.</p>
    <p>In my career up to this point, my chances to get hands-on with this kind of refinement were very limited.  But with programming and web development, it's everywhere, and I'm loving it. Here is some of my work.</p>

    <h2>Selected Iron Yard Projects</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="project">Clipboard for SEEDS</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/SEEDlings/clipboard" class="project-link">on GitHub</a>
      <br>
      Clipboard is a simple, intuitive volunteer check-in app created specifically for <a href="http://www.seedsnc.org">SEEDS</a>, an NC environmental non-profit. The web app saves time and money by both making the check-in process as straightforward as possible, and aiding in capturing volunteer time data, vital to qualify for grants needed to sustain and grow their programs.</p>
    <p><img class="shadow" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5394429/5668973/e1467882-9741-11e4-865e-54e41a7c7823.png"></p>
    <p>Clipboard integrates with a Salesforce database via API, accommodates the existing idiosynchrocies in data structure, automatically handles complexities previously needing a human in the loop, and serves only what is necessary for a smooth, swift user experience.</p>
    <p><img class="shadow" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5394429/5670600/7a374136-974f-11e4-8924-442a6b08506e.png"></p>
    <p>Clipboard was developed over the course of three weeks, by myself, Rebecca Conley, and Pete Byrne, as our capstone project at The Iron Yard.  Developing Clipboard was a great chance to work with a client, get our hands dirty with real-world data, and optimize a solution for specific and evolving requirements.</p>

    <h3 class="project">Trimmer</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/curiousepic/trimmer" class="project-link">on GitHub</a>
      <br>
      An app that presents a Twitter user with their Tweetingest friends. This project involved learning the Twitter API and OmniAuth integration. I had a lot of fun with this, thinking of ways to visually present the list to the user. I realized we could fairly easily scale a visual element proportionally to the data.</p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="project">HALP</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/curiousepic/halp" class="project-link">on GitHub</a>
      <br>
      Our week 6 project was to expand a skeletal project used for making homework help requests. It was fully test-driven and involved setting up a mailer for registration verification and notifications, file uploads, as well as our first deployment on Heroku.</p>
    <p>It's not much to look at, but it was my first project working with a partner, and it was a blast; so much fun getting things done more than twice as fast. We did a lot of planning out the structure on paper and moving post-its around as it evolved.</p>
    <p><img class="shadow" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5394429/5635563/1984075e-95b8-11e4-85fc-6b5d0443cbf4.png"></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="project">Rubylife</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/curiousepic/rubylife" class="project-link">on GitHub</a>
      <br>
      Our 2nd weekend project was a choice between creating Go Fish or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, in Ruby. I've always been enthralled by Life, but was daunted by the math and logic necessary. I'm glad I chose the one I found more challenging.</p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="project">Fog of War</h3>
    <p class="view"><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26046575/Fog%20of%20War%20Rules.pdf" class="project-link" target="_blank">Rules PDF</a>
      <br>
      A rare example of a recreational game design project that attained a state I'm not embarassed to share.  My design goals were to require only a traditional deck of playing cards, elegance of the ruleset, and the core hidden movement mechanic that inspired it. Players take turns taking 7 cards in their hand, some of which may be army cards, and placing them back down without their opponent knowing the exact positioning and layout.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="project">Generative Music Box</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Using a hole-punch music box, I made three strips of paper of different lengths with semi-random holes. Because each strip is a different length but loop through together, different holes align and allow different notes to play on each rotation. The pattern will theoretically repeat, but not for a very, very long time.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="project">Mothership Concepts</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I have a soft-spot for designing spaceships, especially realistic ones.  These were made in Sketchup, as concepts for the universe simulation game <a href="http://en.spaceengine.org">Space Engine</a>, under certain scientific, fictional, and cultural design constraints.</p>
